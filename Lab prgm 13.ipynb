            " Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as images, text, music, or even speech, by learning patterns from a large dataset and then generating output that resembles the original data. It's called \"generative\" because it generates new data rather than just processing or classifying existing data like other AI models.\n",

            "Generative AI models are trained using a technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), or other similar methods. These models consist of two parts: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish the generated data from real data. Over time, the generator improves by learning to create more convincing data that the discriminator can't tell apart from real data.\n",
